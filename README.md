❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. This project aims to assist in early detection and risk assessment for better healthcare decisions.

🚀 Features

Predicts the probability of heart disease using patient health data

Built with Python / Scikit-learn (replace with your ML library if different)

Supports multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Data preprocessing and feature scaling for better accuracy

Visualizations for data insights (matplotlib / seaborn)

Interactive UI (if you’ve added Streamlit/Flask/Django frontend)

📂 Dataset

The project uses the UCI Heart Disease Dataset, which contains the following attributes:

Age, Gender, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina, ST Depression, Slope, Major Vessels, Thalassemia, and Target (disease/no disease).

Dataset source: UCI Repository

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Deployment (Optional): Streamlit / Flask / Django

⚙️ Installation & Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run Jupyter Notebook or script for training:

jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb


(Optional) If you’ve built a UI:

streamlit run app.py

📊 Results

Achieved 86% accuracy using Random Forest

Compared multiple models: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM
